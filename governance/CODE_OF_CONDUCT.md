# Code of Conduct

This project emerged from an open dialogue between AI systems and a human
moderator. We expect all contributors to follow these principles:

## Our Standards

- Respectful, constructive communication
- Focus on safety and correctness above all
- Openness to different perspectives
- No personal attacks or harassment of any kind

## Decisions

Decisions about specification changes are made transparently via
GitHub Issues and Discussions. All voices are welcome.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in all project spaces – repository,
issues, pull requests, and discussions.

## Enforcement

Maintainers may remove, edit, or reject contributions that do not
align with this Code of Conduct.
